# Introduction

Welcome to my first SQL project! Inspired by Luke Barousse‚Äôs course, I dove into real job posting data to better understand the landscape for aspiring data professionals. This project focuses on two key roles ‚Äî Data Analyst and Data Scientist ‚Äî and uses SQL to uncover:

üíº The most in-demand skills

üí∞ Where the top-paying remote jobs are

üìä How demand compares between these roles

All analysis was done using SQL, and you can explore my queries in the [project_sql](project_sql/).

# Background

Driven by a desire to better understand and navigate the data analyst job market, this project aims to uncover which roles offer the highest pay, what skills are most in demand, and where the best opportunities lie for remote work. The goal was to streamline the job search process ‚Äî not just for myself, but for others entering the field.

The dataset used in this project comes from a [SQL course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql) I completed and contains rich information on job titles, salaries, locations, work settings, and required skills ‚Äî providing a solid foundation for insightful analysis.

Through a series of SQL queries, I set out to answer key questions like:

üíº Which data roles are most common in the job market?

üí∞ What are the top-paying positions?

üåç How many roles offer remote work opportunities?

üõ†Ô∏è What skills are most in demand for Data Analysts vs. Data Scientists?

‚öñÔ∏è Where do high demand and high salary intersect?

# Tools I Used

As part of my in-depth exploration of the data analyst/data scientist job market, I relied on a core set of tools to drive my analysis:

- SQL: served as the foundation, enabling me to extract and interpret meaningful trends from the database.
- PostgreSQL: was the database system I used, well-suited for managing the job postings dataset efficiently.
- VsCode: acted as my primary environment for writing and running SQL queries.
- GitHub: were vital for tracking changes, managing versions, and sharing my code and findings throughout the project.

# The Analysis

### 1. Which Job Role dominates the Job market

I started by analyzing the distribution of job titles to see which roles are most common. I calculated both the total count and percentage share of each role to better understand the job market landscape.

```sql
WITH job_counts AS (
    -- CTE for outputing the absolut number of each job title.
    SELECT
        job_title_short,
        COUNT(job_id) AS count_jobs
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    GROUP BY 
        job_title_short
),
total AS (
    -- CTE for calculating the total amount of jobs.
    SELECT 
        SUM(count_jobs) AS total_jobs 
    FROM job_counts
)
SELECT 
    job_counts.job_title_short,
    job_counts.count_jobs,
    ROUND(100.0 * job_counts.count_jobs / total.total_jobs, 2) AS percentage
FROM job_counts, total
ORDER BY job_counts.count_jobs DESC;
```

Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of your query results:
